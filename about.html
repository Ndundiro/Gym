        Tipping the scale at 346 pounds with high blood pressure, a pre-diabetic Jay still wasn’t ready to change his lifestyle.  First, second and third attempts at weight loss had failed. Jay became the ultimate yo-yo dieter, with an unhealthy relationship with food and an aversion to physical activity.
</p>
<p>
        It wasn’t until January 2013, when a close friend who was the same age as he, died of health complications associated with obesity. Soon after,Jay made the decision to adopt a healthy lifestyle. He chose to forgo all lose-weight-quick schemes in favor of balanced nutrition and exercise.I had come to realise that there is never a "quick fix".
</p>
<p>
I soon changed my relationship with food.Always striving to eat healthy.Aside from the common myth.healthy dosent have to be boring.i had always be close minded when it came to food.I believe in balance and need for occasional indulgence.Trying new foods has become a lifestyle.

<p>
    The key to weight loss and healthy living is to learn your body.There is no magic formula.There is no finish line when it comes to healthy living.there is more you can accomplish everyday.You can get in any shape you dream of.If you can dream it,<em>and put in the work</em> you can achieve it.
